This practice problem focused more on seat rows and columns.I was to create a 30 seat arrangement with 5 rows. I was on the app called "solo learn" and
this was a mini practice coding lab on my data science with python journey.

import numpy as np
data = np.array([1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0])
row = int(input())
data = data.reshape(6,5)
print(data[row])
