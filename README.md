# Summer-2022-ANL.
This will serve as a journal where I will be documenting majority of the work I have done during my internship.

Coming into this internship I had very little knowledge on what "Data Science" was and I was still actively learning about CyberSecurity. I was offered a position with the Data Science and Learning division at the Argonne National Laboratory through the DOE-CCI program.I was offered the position by my mentor Ravi Madduri to work on the PALISADE-X project. APPFL, APPFL is an open-source software framework that allows research communities to implement, test, and validate various ideas for privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL). This internship was really educative beforehand, I had only heard of data science I had not thought of learning or using Data Science concepts before it and as my internship progressed i learnt more about it.

Here is a link to my google doc where i documented my day to day work experience learning.

I would  like to thank my mentor Mr Ravi Madduri for selecting me to be under his wing during the time of my internship and truly it has been a very educative experience. I would be learning more about Data Science as time moves on.
